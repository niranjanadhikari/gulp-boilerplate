This is a fairly simple gulp project with gulp 3.9.1 the gulp has changed from version 4 and I was having problem setting up browsersync so attempted to downgrade and everything seems to be working fine.

## Start working 🚀

- clone the project
- run Yarn or npm i command to install dependencies
- configure surge, add domain name in package json (search for <domain name here>)

- start exploring
